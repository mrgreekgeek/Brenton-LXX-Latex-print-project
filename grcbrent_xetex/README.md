All of the files in this directory (except for this README) are copied directly from ebible.org's [XeTeX file for Brenton's LXX](https://ebible.org/Scriptures/grcbrent_xetex.zip). This edition of the LXX is in the public domain, according to [ebible.org](https://ebible.org/Scriptures/details.php?id=grcbrent). We don't modify them at all, they're just the source for `concatenated.tex` which is then  modified by `process.py` to create `Brenton.tex`.
